      <p> I am "<em>Nlha'ka7pmx.</em><strong> Our people have been and continue to be nourished by a wealth of biodiversity including fish, wild game, berries, roots, and
        medicines. Hunting & gathering these resources requires a localized knowledge of that is dictated by the seasonal cycles of the land. Nlha7ka'pmx families have always
        and continue to be united by the hunting, fishing, harvesting, and gathering of food as the traditional gathering of these foods on the land is ceremony itself and
        demonstrates honor and respect for the tmixʷ (all living things). As caretakers of the land is the Nlha7ka'mx members have the right to utilize
        the land and water to the best of its abilities so that future generations may gather from those same places. Life within Nlha7ka'pmx communities is built upon respect.
        To care for the land is to care for the people.</strong></p>

      <h3>The Nlha’ka7pmx people are among the original inhabitants of the Fraser, Thompson, and Nicola river valleys in southwestern British Columbia.
      In this collection of traditional oral narratives and legends, which have been passed from generation to generation for centuries, the elders tell
      the story of their people. Put together entirely by Nlha’ka7pmx people, Our Telling’s written by Darwin Hanna and Mamie Henry reveals how they perceive
      their own history. It is their hope that through sharing these stories, they will inspire others to continue to create stories and to contribute to
      the cultural revitalization of Canada’s Native peoples.</h3>

    <h4>Language:
      nsyilxcən Language
      nsyilxcən is the language spoken by and distinguishes the Syilx/Okanagan from other indigenous peoples.
      It is part of the Salish language family which is distinct from our Salish neighbors, like the Spokane,
      the Nla7ka’pmux, and the Secwepemc. nsyilxcən is spoken in all the districts of the Syilx/Okanagan territory
      with varying dialects.

      As part of colonization Indian Residential Schools were introduced and Indigenous Peoples were severely punished for
      speaking their own languages and forced to speak English, resulting in a severe loss of the language retention in our communities.
