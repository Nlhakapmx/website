    <h3>The Nlha’ka7pmx people are among the original inhabitants of the Fraser, Thompson, and Nicola river valleys in southwestern British Columbia. In this collection of traditional oral narratives and legends, which have been passed from generation to generation for centuries, the elders tell the story of their people. Put together entirely by Nlha’ka7pmx people, Our Telling’s reveals how they perceive their own history. It is their hope that through sharing these stories, they will inspire others to continue to create stories and to contribute to the cultural revitalization of Canada’s Native peoples.</h3>

    <h3>Language
      nsyilxcən Language
      nsyilxcən is the language spoken by and distinguishes the Syilx/Okanagan from other indigenous peoples.
      It is part of the Salish language family which is distinct from our Salish neighbors, like the Spokane,
      the Nla7ka’pmux, and the Secwepemc. nsyilxcən is spoken in all the districts of the Syilx/Okanagan territory
      with varying dialects.

As part of colonization Indian Residential Schools were introduced and Indigenous Peoples were severely punished for speaking their own languages and forced to speak English, resulting in a severe loss of the language retention in our communities.
