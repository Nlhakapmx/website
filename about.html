    <h2>Seytknmx - Indigenous peoples</h2>

    <h3>The Nlha’ka7pmx people are among the original inhabitants of the Fraser, Thompson, and Nicola river valleys in southwestern British Columbia. In this collection of traditional oral narratives and legends, which have been passed from generation to generation for centuries, the elders tell the story of their people. Put together entirely by Nlha’ka7pmx people, Our Telling’s reveals how they perceive their own history. It is their hope that through sharing these stories, they will inspire others to continue to create stories and to contribute to the cultural revitalization of Canada’s Native peoples. </h3>
